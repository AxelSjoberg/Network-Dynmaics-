Repo for the Network Dynmaics FRTN30 course at LTH 


## Handin 1
This exercise covered calculating different centrality measurements (in,our,katz,..) of different economic sectors over various countries and measuring the influence on twitter using pageRank centrality and discrete time consensus algorithms.

## Handin 2 
This exercise covered single- and multiple-particle random walks on graphs. The crucial concepts covered in the lab were hitting time, return time and for these the simulated versus the theoretical were compared for different scenarios. The mulitple-particle random walks were covered from the node perspective as well as from the particle perspictive and the difference(indifference in implementation as well as results illustrated that the perspective of the RW is not trivial.

## Handin 3 
This exercise covered toll design on roads to reduce the wardop equilibrium to the social optimum output and implementing a potential function for a graph coloring game. 

## Handin 4 
This exercise was centered around modelling the H1N1 pandemic in Sweden 2009. More precisely, we wanted to find the  $\beta$, $\rho$ and a graph which reasonably well mimics the social interactions of the swedish population. For this exercise I created an epidemic package which is included in this repo
